Annotated lists of my how-to videos are excerpted to this page for easy browsing.

The original context is  embeded in my brain imaging [notes](http://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/wiki/brainImagingGuide),  and [code](http://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/source/browse/), which are consolidated [here at googlecode](http://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/).

Update notification is available [newsfeed](via.md) or by [youtube subscription](http://youtube.com/stowler).

(Notice that each of the annotated playlist below is also a google gadget you can [to your iGoogle page](add.md) if you're into that.)
