brainwhere.googlecode.com is home for my brain MRI development work, which benefits from heavy lifting by [FSL](http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/) and [AFNI](http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/).

This is also where I host an evolving [guide](http://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/wiki/brainImagingGuide) for brain MRI processing and analysis.

# things you might be looking for here #
  * [brain imaging guide](http://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/wiki/brainImagingGuide) (and its [changelog](https://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/source/list?repo=wiki))
  * most recent version of brainwhere scripts ([browse](https://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/source/browse/#hg), or see [changelog](https://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/source/list))
  * Crosson Lab path: /data/birc/RESEARCH/brainwhere (or $bwDir)
  * my [contact information](http://contact.stephentowler.net) or [calendar](http://calendar.stephentowler.net)


# how to be notified of changes #
Subscribe to these newsfeeds to receive automatic notification of changes:
  * [changes to code](https://code.google.com/feeds/p/brainwhere/hgchanges/basic)

# (Why code.google.com and not /home/stowler/scripts?) #
Breaking from more casual scientific coding, code.google.com provides:
  * powerful revision control via [mercurial](http://hginit.com/)
  * syntax-highlighted [code browsing](https://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/source/browse/#hg) for easy auditing
  * [issue tracking](http://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/issues/list)
  * a sane platform for rapidly evolving [documentation](http://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/wiki/brainImagingGuide) (easier access and better revision management than Word)
  * automatic end-user notification of updates via [newsfeeds](https://code.google.com/p/brainwhere/feeds)
  * eventual scalability: it will be easier to share development responsibilities if code isn't distributed among various ~/scripts/.
